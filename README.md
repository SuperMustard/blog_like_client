# React + Redux + Vite

This is a practice project using the Redux toolkit to manage states. Using React Route to navigate pages and using Vite to build this project.

In this project, I have implemented a blog-like client where you can view posts, create a new post or edit posts. We use Jsonplaceholder as our server. In this situation, we can't really add a new post or edit posts. We can only see a tempera result. After refreshing the page, every change will lost.
